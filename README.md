# arjun-parallel-assignment-2

Hi!

To run the code for problem 1, simply clone the repo and either run (MinotaurParty.java) it in a Java IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse. 

Alternatively you can run the commands in the command line:
```
javac MinotaurParty.java
java MinotaurParty
```

For problem 2, run CrystalRoom.java. The commands are:
```
javac CrystalRoom.java
java CrystalRoom
```
I wrote the reason why I picked the option I picked for problem 2 in docs/Problem2.md.

I used OpenJDK 17. Once run, the output will be printed on the console. This is different from assignment 1 because there was no output format specified so I did whatever made more sense to me.

Have a nice day!
