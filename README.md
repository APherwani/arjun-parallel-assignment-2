Hi!

To run the code, simply clone the repo and either run it in a Java IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse. 

Alternatively you can run the commands in the command line:
```
javac eratosthenes.java
java eratosthenes
```

I used OpenJDK 17. Once run, the output will be printed in a file called primes.txt which is in the output directory.

Also included is a director called docs, which contains all explanations and related documentation.

Have a nice day!
